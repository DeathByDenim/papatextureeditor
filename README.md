Papa Texture Editor
====

Editor for the papa texture for Planetary Annihilation.
So far you can view all of the textures. Saving them into the papa file is only possible for A8R8B8G8 and X8R8B8G8. Still working on the others, but you can also use the tool papatran that comes with Planetary Annihilation.
